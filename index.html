        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <h3>70% of government, e-commerce and news site are inaccessible to the visually impaired</h3>
        <p>Issues such as low contrast text and colors hard to distinguish for those with colorblindness make accessing large parts of the web impossible for many users. While this issue may seem insignificant, sources estimate that sites with these issues lose approximately 7 billion dollars in potential revenue annually.<a href="https://www.deque.com/blog/research-shows-internet-is-unavailable-to-blind-users/">Nucleus Research</a></p>
        <h3>More than 2.2 billion people worldwide have some level of visual impairments</h3>
        <p>This number shows just how many people benefit from technologies such as screen readers. While making sites compatible with screen readers seems complicated, as a matter of fact it is often as simple as adding a single phrase to each piece of media on a site. <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/the-journey-to-accessible-apps-screen-readers/#:~:text=Studying%20Screen%20Readers,when%20navigating%20the%20digital%20world.">Microsoft</a></p>
        <h3>Web accessiblity is finally starting to be enforced - in 2022 in the US alone, 2,387 digital acccessiblity lawsuits were filed in the USA under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h3>
        <p>Similarly how one can sue for missing physical accomdations, you can also sue over missing web accessiblity accomodations. While companies may try to convince you that this is an extreme option, laws such as the ADA require them to make reasonable accomodations for all users.
